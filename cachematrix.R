## Inverting a matrix can be computationnally intensive
## If we invert the same matrix multiple times, it can be worth caching the result

##        X = matrix(data=c(2,0,0,2),nrow=2,ncol=2)
##        M = makeCacheMatrix(X)
## Creates a special matrix M and caches its inverse
##
##        N = cacheSolve(M)
## computes the inverse of the special matrix M
## if the inverse has already been computed
## gets it from cache



## this function creates a special matrix, which is a list containing
## a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(X = matrix()) {

	# A contains the value of the inverse, if cached
